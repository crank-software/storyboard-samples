<H1>Setting up the Custom Lua Module Demo</H1>

<H2>Compiling the Source Code</H2>
The code for the binary Lua module can be found <i>source_code</i> 
directory of the project.  This source must be compiled into a shared
library suitable for the target where the application will be run.  If the
application is being developed for multiple platforms (embedded and simulation)
then this may require that several builds be performed.<p>

The source is straightforward and uses standard ANSI C89 types,
but requires that the include path and library path include 
the path to the Storyboard headers and libraries and the Storyboard Lua 
headers and libraries.<p>

Assuming a base path to a specific Storyboard Engine distribution is
defined as <b>SB_ROOT</b>:
<ul>
<dl>
<dt>Headers</dt>
<dd>The Storyboard Lua header file <i>lua/lua.h</i> is located in 
the <i>include</i> sub-directory of the runtime engine.</dd>
<dt>Libraries</dt>
<dd>The Storyboard Lua library <i>libsblua.[a|so|lib|dll]</i> is located in
the <i>lib</i> sub-directory of the runtime engine.</dd>
</dl><p>
</ul>

A sample Makefile for a build might look something like this:
<pre>
SB_ROOT=/Applications/Crank_Software/Storyboard_Engine/3.1.0.201304081236/macos-x86-opengles_2.0-obj
SB_INC=-I$(SB_ROOT)/include
SB_LIB=-L$(SB_ROOT)/lib -lsblua

CFLAGS += -fPIC
LDFLAGS += -shared

sbmodule.so: sbmodule.c
	$(CC) $(SB_INC) -o sbmodule sbmodule.c $(SB_LIB)
</pre><p>

The compiler and linker flags that are required to create a shared library may
vary from platform to platform.  Consult your toolchain documentation for details
on how to create shared libraries ready for dynamic loading.

There is a sample Makefie provided.  This is a GNU makefile.  For building on Windows 
you will need to install GNU Makefile for windows. 

Sections have been provided that should allow for a quick start setup to build the module.  In 
order to use the Makefile, it will need to be edited and the following variables will need to be 
set:
<pre>
	SB_INSTALL
	BUILD_TYPE
	SB_ROOT
	SB_TARGET_DIR
</pre>

The Makefile contains explanations for what those variables need to be set to. 

<H4>Building with Visual Studio</H4>
Clients building this sample for Visual Studio may require additional standard C 
library headers (inttypes.h, stdint.h) depending on their version of Visual Studio.<br>

Storyboard Suite provides the missing headers for these types in the 
<i>include/[win32|wince|wincompact7]</i> sub-directories of the Windows 
flavoured Storyboard Engine distributions.<p>

<H2>Additional Lua and Lua Module Resources</H2>

<ul>
<li>The Lua C API for interacting with the Lua execution environment is well documented 
in the <a src="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/">Lua  Reference Manual 
(http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/)</a>.

<li>Additional information on creating Lua modules in both binary and non-binary forms
can be found on the <a src="http://lua-users.org/wiki/BuildingModules">Lua Users
Wiki</a>.  

<li>The software developers guide <a src=http://www.lua.org/pil/">Programming
in Lua<a> also contains a substantial amount of information on both the use of the
Lua C API as well as the use of Lua in more detailed contexts.
